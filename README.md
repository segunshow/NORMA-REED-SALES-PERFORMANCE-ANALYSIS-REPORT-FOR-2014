### Project Summary:

This project is a simulated sales performance analysis conducted as part of my learning at Vephla University. Using fictional data, I built a comprehensive Excel dashboard to explore key performance trends across salespeople, customers, cities, and product categories for the year 2014.

### Objective:
To analyze and visualize sales data in order to identify the following:

Top performers and revenue contributors

Sales trends by month, product, and region

Risk areas such as customer over-reliance

Actionable business recommendations to improve sales strategy

### Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers)

Dashboard design principles

Data storytelling & business reasoning

### Key Insights:
Some salespeople and companies are over-reliant on single customers or regions.

High-revenue products like Beverages are underutilized by certain teams.

Sales performance is inconsistent across months and locations.

Recommendations focus on customer diversification, regional expansion, and boosting underperforming product categories.
